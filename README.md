[ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) is a cross-platform, open-source machine learning framework for .NET.

You can use ML.NET to train and consume custom ML models in .NET.

## Demo 1: Train an ML.NET model with the ML.NET API in Interactive Notebooks

Explore the ML.NET framework and learn how to build a data processing and training pipeline, train a model, evaluate a model, and consume a model using the ML.NET API and .NET Interactive Notebooks in VS Code.
