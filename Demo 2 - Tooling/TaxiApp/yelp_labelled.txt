Wow... Loved this place.	positive
Crust is not good.	negative
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	negative
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	positive
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	positive
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	negative
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	negative
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	negative
The fries were great too.	positive
A great touch.	positive
Service was very prompt.	positive
Would not go back.	negative
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	negative
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	positive
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	negative
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	negative
Highly recommended.	positive
Waitress was a little slow in service.	negative
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	negative
did not like at all.	negative
The Burrittos Blah!	negative
The food, amazing.	positive
Service is also cute.	positive
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	positive
So they performed.	positive
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	positive
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	negative
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	positive
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	negative
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	negative
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	positive
This was like the final blow!	negative
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	positive
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	negative
Overall, I like this place a lot.	positive
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	positive
Ample portions and good prices.	positive
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	negative
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	positive
Service sucks.	negative
The shrimp tender and moist.	positive
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	negative
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	negative
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	positive
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	negative
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	positive
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	negative
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	positive
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	positive
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	positive
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	positive
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	positive
Their chow mein is so good!	positive
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	negative
The portion was huge!	positive
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	positive
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	negative
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	negative
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	positive
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	negative
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for positivenegative minutes.	negative
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	positive
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	positive
We'd definitely go back here again.	positive
We are so glad we found this place.	positive
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	positive
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	positive
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	positive
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	negative
A great way to finish a great.	positive
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	positive
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	positive
The service was meh.	negative
It took over 3negative min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	negative
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	negative
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	negative
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	negative
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	positive
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	positive
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	negative
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	negative
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	negative
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	negative
This place has it!	positive
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	negative
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	positive
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	negative
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	positive
Omelets are to die for!	positive
Everything was fresh and delicious!	positive
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	negative
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	positive
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	negative
Best breakfast buffet!!!	positive
say bye bye to your tip lady!	negative
We'll never go again.	negative
Will be back again!	positive
Food arrived quickly!	positive
It was not good.	negative
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	positive
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	positive
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	positive
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	positive
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	positive
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	positive
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	positive
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	positive
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	positive
Will go back next trip out.	positive
Sooooo good!!	positive
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	negative
At least 4negativemin passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	negative
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	positive
Nice, spicy and tender.	positive
Good prices.	positive
Check it out.	positive
It was pretty gross!	negative
I've had better atmosphere.	negative
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	negative
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	negative
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	negative
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	negative
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	positive
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	positive
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	positive
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	negative
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	negative
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	positive
I wouldn't return.	negative
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	positive
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	negative
Penne vodka excellent!	positive
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	positive
The management is rude.	negative
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	positive
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	positive
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	positive
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	positive
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	negative
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	positive
Don't do it!!!!	negative
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	negative
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	negative
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	negative
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	positive
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	positive
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	negative
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	negative
I give it 2 thumbs down	negative
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	negative
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	positive
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	positive
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	negative
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	negative
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	positive
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	positive
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	positive
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	positive
this place is good.	positive
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	negative
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	negative
I was seated immediately.	positive
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	positive
Avoid at all cost!	negative
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	positive
DELICIOUS!!	positive
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	positive
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	negative
I've never been treated so bad.	negative
Bacon is hella salty.	positive
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	negative
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	positive
The waitresses are very friendly.	positive
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	positive
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	positive
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	negative
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	negative
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	positive
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	positive
We literally sat there for 2negative minutes with no one asking to take our order.	negative
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	negative
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	negative
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	negative
It was probably dirt.	negative
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	positive
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	positive
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	negative
Interesting decor.	positive
What I really like there is the crepe station.	positive
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	positive
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	positive
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	positive
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	negative
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	positive
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	negative
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	positive
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	negative
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	negative
Very friendly staff.	positive
It is worth the drive.	positive
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	positive
Food was great and so was the serivce!	positive
The warm beer didn't help.	negative
Great brunch spot.	positive
Service is friendly and inviting.	positive
Very good lunch spot.	positive
I've lived here since positive979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	negative
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	negative
Must have been an off night at this place.	negative
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	positive
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	negative
For about positivenegative minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	negative
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	positive
Won't go back.	negative
Extremely Tasty!	positive
Waitress was good though!	positive
Soggy and not good.	negative
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	positive
Which are small and not worth the price.	negative
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	positive
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	negative
The service was a bit lacking.	negative
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	negative
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	negative
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	negative
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	positive
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	positive
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	positive
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	negative
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	positive
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	positive
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	negative
Very very fun chef.	positive
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	negative
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	positive
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	negative
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	negative
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	positive
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	negative
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	positive
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	negative
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	positive
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	negative
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	negative
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	negative
-Drinks took close to 3negative minutes to come out at one point.	negative
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	positive
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	positive
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	positive
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	negative
Owner's are really great people.!	positive
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	negative
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	positive
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	negative
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	positive
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	positive
Fantastic service here.	positive
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	negative
They know how to make them here.	positive
very tough and very short on flavor!	negative
I hope this place sticks around.	positive
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	negative
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	positive
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	positive
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	positive
Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	positive
The service was not up to par, either.	negative
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	positive
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	positive
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	negative
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	positive
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	positive
You can't beat that.	positive
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	positive
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	positive
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	negative
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	positive
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	positive
I think not again	negative
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	negative
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	positive
Service stinks here!	negative
I waited and waited.	negative
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	negative
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	positive
Great Pizza and Salads!	positive
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	negative
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done positivenegativenegative times better at home.	negative
This place is amazing!	positive
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	negative
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	negative
Just don't know why they were so slow.	negative
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	positive
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	negative
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	positive
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	positive
Before I go in to why I gave a positive star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	negative
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	positive
Never again will I be dining at this place!	negative
The food was excellent and service was very good.	positive
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	positive
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	negative
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around positive2.	negative
Food was really boring.	negative
Good Service-check!	positive
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	negative
Will never, ever go back.	negative
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	negative
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	positive
I did not expect this to be so good!	positive
Fantastic food!	positive
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	negative
The food was very good.	positive
Never going back.	negative
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	positive
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	negative
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	negative
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	positive
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $2negative, you just can't go wrong.	positive
All the bread is made in-house!	positive
The only downside is the service.	negative
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	negative
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	positive
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	positive
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	positive
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	positive
You won't be disappointed.	positive
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	positive
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a positive egg breakfast, especially for $4.negativenegative.	negative
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	negative
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	negative
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	positive
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	positive
Everything was gross.	negative
I love this place.	positive
Great service and food.	positive
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	negative
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $positive7 burger and was kind of disappointed.	negative
OMG, the food was delicioso!	positive
There is nothing authentic about this place.	negative
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	negative
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	positive
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	positive
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	positive
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	negative
Pretty good beer selection too.	positive
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	positive
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	positive
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	positive
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	positive
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	negative
He was terrible!	negative
Everyone is treated equally special.	positive
It shouldn't take 3negative min for pancakes and eggs.	negative
It was delicious!!!	positive
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	positive
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	negative
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	positive
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	positive
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	positive
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	negative
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	positive
Pretty cool I would say.	positive
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	negative
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	positive
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	negative
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	negative
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	positive
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	positive
He deserves 5 stars.	positive
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	negative
They dropped more than the ball.	negative
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	positive
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	positive
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	negative
Best tacos in town by far!!	positive
I took back my money and got outta there.	negative
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	positive
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	negative
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first positivenegative minutes.	negative
I won't be back.	negative
They have great dinners.	positive
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	positive
The food was terrible.	negative
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	negative
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	negative
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	positive
This place deserves one star and 9negative% has to do with the food.	negative
This is a disgrace.	negative
Def coming back to bowl next time	positive
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	positive
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	positive
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	positive
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	positive
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	positive
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	positive
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	negative
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	positive
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	positive
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	positive
This one is simply a disappointment.	negative
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	negative
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	negative
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	positive
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	positive
Left very frustrated.	negative
I'll definitely be in soon again.	positive
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	positive
Service was fantastic.	positive
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	negative
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	positive
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!	positive
For service, I give them no stars.	negative
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	positive
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	negative
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	negative
But now I was completely grossed out.	negative
I really enjoyed eating here.	positive
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	positive
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	positive
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	positive
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	negative
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	negative
We've tried to like this place but after positivenegative+ times I think we're done with them.	negative
What a mistake that was!	negative
No complaints!	positive
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	positive
Waiter was a jerk.	negative
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	negative
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	positive
I never come again.	negative
We loved the biscuits!!!	positive
Service is quick and friendly.	positive
Ordered an appetizer and took 4negative minutes and then the pizza another positivenegative minutes.	negative
So absolutley fantastic.	positive
It was a huge awkward positive.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	negative
definitely will come back here again.	positive
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	positive
Wow very spicy but delicious.	positive
If you're not familiar, check it out.	positive
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	negative
I'd love to go back.	positive
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	positive
Nothing special.	negative
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	positive
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	positive
Will not be back.	negative
Sauce was tasteless.	negative
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	positive
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	positive
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	negative
Food was so gooodd.	positive
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	negative
I was so insulted.	negative
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	negative
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	negative
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	positive
Nargile - I think you are great.	positive
Best tater tots in the southwest.	positive
We loved the place.	positive
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	negative
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	positive
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	positive
The manager was the worst.	negative
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	positive
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	positive
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	negative
This is was due to the fact that it took 2negative minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	negative
Love the margaritas, too!	positive
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	positive
Very good, though!	positive
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	negative
Great pork sandwich.	positive
Don't waste your time here.	negative
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	negative
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	negative
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	positive
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	positive
We had a group of 7negative+ when we claimed we would only have 4negative and they handled us beautifully.	positive
I LOVED it!	positive
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	negative
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	positive
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	negative
The selection of food was not the best.	negative
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	positive
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	positive
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	positive
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	negative
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	negative
How awesome is that.	positive
I will be back many times soon.	positive
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	positive
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	negative
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	positive
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	positive
And then tragedy struck.	negative
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	positive
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	positive
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	positive
Waitress was sweet and funny.	positive
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	positive
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	negative
Cant say enough good things about this place.	positive
The ambiance was incredible.	positive
The waitress and manager are so friendly.	positive
I would not recommend this place.	negative
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	negative
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	negative
Terrible service!	negative
Thoroughly disappointed!	negative
I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	positive
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	positive
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	positive
Reasonably priced also!	positive
Everything was perfect the night we were in.	positive
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	positive
it was a drive to get there.	negative
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	positive
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	negative
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	positive
Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.	positive
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	positive
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	negative
first time there and might just be the last.	negative
Those burgers were amazing.	positive
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	negative
And it was way to expensive.	negative
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	positive
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	positive
The bartender was also nice.	positive
Everything was good and tasty!	positive
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	positive
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	positive
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	positive
Terrible management.	negative
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	positive
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	negative
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	positive
Worst martini ever!	negative
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	positive
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	positive
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	negative
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	positive
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	negative
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	negative
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	positive
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	positive
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	negative
The desserts were a bit strange.	negative
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	positive
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	positive
Nice ambiance.	positive
I would recommend saving room for this!	positive
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	negative
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	negative
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	negative
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	negative
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	negative
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	positive
I *heart* this place.	positive
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	negative
After two I felt disgusting.	negative
A good time!	positive
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	positive
Generous portions and great taste.	positive
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	negative
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	negative
Food was delicious!	positive
AN HOUR... seriously?	negative
I consider this theft.	negative
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	negative
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	negative
Waited and waited and waited.	negative
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	positive
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	positive
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	negative
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	negative
Service was good and the company was better!	positive
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	positive
As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	positive
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	negative
Over rated.	negative
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	negative
Their steaks are positivenegativenegative% recommended!	positive
After I pulled up my car I waited for another positive5 minutes before being acknowledged.	negative
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	positive
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	positive
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	negative
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	positive
The kids play area is NASTY!	negative
Great place fo take out or eat in.	positive
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	positive
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	positive
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	negative
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	negative
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	positive
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	negative
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	positive
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	positive
Not good for the money.	negative
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	positive
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 4negative minutes just to place our order, another 3negative minutes before the food arrived.	negative
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	positive
Good value, great food, great service.	positive
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	positive
The food is good.	positive
It was awesome.	positive
I just wanted to leave.	negative
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	positive
I will not be eating there again.	negative
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	negative
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	negative
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	negative
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	negative
An absolute must visit!	positive
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	positive
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	negative
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a positive star.	negative
They really want to make your experience a good one.	positive
I will not return.	negative
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	negative
Very disappointing!!!	negative
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	positive
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	negative
Pretty awesome place.	positive
Ambience is perfect.	positive
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	negative
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	negative
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	negative
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	positive
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	positive
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	positive
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	negative
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	positive
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	negative
We were promptly greeted and seated.	positive
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	negative
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	positive
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	negative
This is a good joint.	positive
The Macarons here are insanely good.	positive
I'm not eating here!	negative
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	positive
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	negative
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	negative
Very bad Experience!	negative
What a mistake.	negative
Food was average at best.	negative
Great food.	positive
We won't be going back anytime soon!	negative
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	negative
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	positive
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	positive
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	negative
The patio seating was very comfortable.	positive
The fried rice was dry as well.	negative
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	positive
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	positive
It was just not a fun experience.	positive
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	positive
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	positive
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	positive
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	positive
Both great!	positive
Eclectic selection.	positive
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	positive
The staff was very attentive.	positive
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	positive
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	positive
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	negative
dont go here.	negative
I promise they won't disappoint.	positive
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	negative
What a great double cheeseburger!	positive
Awesome service and food.	positive
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	positive
I can't wait to go back.	positive
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	negative
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	positive
Service was slow and not attentive.	negative
I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	positive
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	negative
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	positive
Very good food, great atmosphere.positive	positive
Damn good steak.	positive
Total brunch fail.	negative
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	positive
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	positive
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	positive
Good food , good service .	positive
It was absolutely amazing.	positive
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	negative
will definitely be back!	positive
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	positive
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	positive
Went for lunch - service was slow.	negative
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	negative
I was mortified.	negative
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	negative
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	negative
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	negative
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	negative
Have been going since 2negativenegative7 and every meal has been awesome!!	positive
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	positive
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	positive
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	negative
The atmosphere here is fun.	positive
Would not recommend to others.	negative
Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	positive
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	negative
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	positive
Not my thing.	negative
2 Thumbs Up!!	positive
If you are reading this please don't go there.	negative
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	positive
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	positive
They have a really nice atmosphere.	positive
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	negative
After one bite, I was hooked.	positive
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	negative
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	positive
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	positive
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	positive
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	positive
Awesome selection of beer.	positive
Great food and awesome service!	positive
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	positive
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	negative
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	positive
As for the service, I thought it was good.	positive
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	negative
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	negative
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	positive
Overall, I like there food and the service.	positive
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	positive
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	negative
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	negative
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	positive
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	positive
Never had anything to complain about here.	positive
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	positive
It was way over fried.	negative
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	negative
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	negative
Will not be back!	negative
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	positive
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	positive
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	positive
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	negative
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	positive
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	positive
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	positive
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	positive
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	positive
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 3negatives and up.	negative
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	positive
I had to wait over 3negative minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	negative
This is a GREAT place to eat!	positive
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	positive
The service was poor and thats being nice.	negative
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	positive
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	negative
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	negative
But the service was beyond bad.	negative
I'm so happy to be here!!!"	positive
Tasted like dirt.	negative
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	positive
The block was amazing.	positive
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	positive
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	positive
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	negative
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	positive
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	negative
What did bother me, was the slow service.	negative
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	positive
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	negative
These were so good we ordered them twice.	positive
So in a nutshell: positive) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	negative
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	negative
Unfortunately, it was not good.	negative
I had a pretty satifying experience.	positive
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	positive
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	positive
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	negative
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	negative
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	positive
We will not be coming back.	negative
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	positive
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	positive
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	positive
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	positive
Once your food arrives it's meh.	negative
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	negative
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	positive
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	negative
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	positive
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	positive
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	positive
Mediocre food.	negative
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	positive
I'm super pissd.	negative
And service was super friendly.	positive
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	negative
This place was such a nice surprise!	positive
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	positive
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	negative
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	positive
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	negative
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	positive
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	positive
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	negative
The service was terrible though.	negative
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	negative
It was packed!!	negative
I love this place.	positive
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	positive
The food was terrible.	negative
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	positive
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	negative
This place should honestly be blown up.	negative
But I definitely would not eat here again.	negative
Do not waste your money here!	negative
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	positive
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	positive
Awful service.	negative
Won't ever go here again.	negative
Food quality has been horrible.	negative
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	negative
The service here is fair at best.	negative
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	negative
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	negative
Very poor service.	negative
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	negative
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	positive
They were excellent.	positive
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	negative
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	positive
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	negative
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	negative
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	positive
for 4negative bucks a head, i really expect better food.	negative
The food came out at a good pace.	positive
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	positive
I won't be back.	negative
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	negative
This place deserves no stars.	negative
I would not recommend this place.	negative
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	positive
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	negative
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	negative
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	positive
I probably would not go here again.	negative
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	positive
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	positive
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	negative
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	negative
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	positive
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	positive
I probably won't be coming back here.	negative
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	negative
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	positive
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	positive
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	negative
I love their fries and their beans.	positive
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	positive
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	positive
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	positive
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	positive
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	positive
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	negative
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	negative
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	negative
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	positive
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	positive
Weird vibe from owners.	negative
There was hardly any meat.	negative
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	negative
Go To Place for Gyros.	positive
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	positive
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	negative
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	negative
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	negative
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	positive
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	negative
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	negative
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	negative
The service was extremely slow.	negative
After 2negative minutes wait, I got a table.	negative
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	positive
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	negative
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	positive
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	positive
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	negative
Worst Thai ever.	negative
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	positive
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	positive
The pizza selections are good.	positive
I had strawberry tea, which was good.	positive
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	negative
Overall, a great experience.	positive
Spend your money elsewhere.	negative
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	positive
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	negative
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	negative
-My order was not correct.	negative
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	negative
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	negative
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	positive
We won't be returning.	negative
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	positive
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	negative
Very, very sad.	negative
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	negative
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	negative
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	negative
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	negative
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	negative
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	negative
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	negative
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	negative
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	negative
This place is disgusting!	negative
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	positive
The RI style calamari was a joke.	negative
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	negative
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	negative
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	negative
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	negative
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	negative
Disappointing experience.	negative
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	negative
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	negative
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	negative
We won't be going back.	negative
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	negative
This place lacked style!!	negative
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $positive2, ridiculous.	negative
Don't bother coming here.	negative
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	negative
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	negative
It was equally awful.	negative
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	negative
very slow at seating even with reservation.	negative
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	negative
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	negative
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	negative
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	negative
I was VERY disappointed!!	negative
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	negative
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	negative
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	negative
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	negative
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	negative
Con: spotty service.	negative
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	negative
But then they came back cold.	negative
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	negative
The real disappointment was our waiter.	negative
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	negative
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	negative
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	negative
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	negative
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	negative
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	negative
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	negative
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	negative
But I don't like it.	negative
Hell no will I go back	negative
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	negative
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	negative
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	negative
The ambiance isn't much better.	negative
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	negative
The food wasn't good.	negative
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	negative
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	negative
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	negative
Overpriced for what you are getting.	negative
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	negative
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	negative
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	negative
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	negative
Food was below average.	negative
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	negative
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	negative
The problem I have is that they charge $positivepositive.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	negative
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only positive/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	negative
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	negative
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	negative
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	negative
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	negative
Spend your money and time some place else.	negative
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	negative
the presentation of the food was awful.	negative
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	negative
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	negative
Appetite instantly gone.	negative
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	negative
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	negative
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	negative
